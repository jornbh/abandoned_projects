## This is cancer, but the best kind of cancer

* These scripts use crontab to cycle through a folder with pictures from the new she-ra. Because why not.
* To stop the script run crontab -e and remove all lines containing the names of the files in this folder
* If you want to start this on your own Linux-machine, run make_repository.sh from anywhere and pulling from git, as well as seting up crontab will be handled



...

* If you are having a hard time removing this, just contact me. I did not bother to write a proper script for it.
